# What is SESTA/FOSTA?

Following excerpt from the [Stop SESTA](https://stopsesta.org) site:

---

On February 27, the House of Representatives passed a bill that combined the Senate’s Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (SESTA) and the House’s Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA). This new version of FOSTA would:

- Expand existing federal criminal sex trafficking law to target online platforms where sex trafficking content appears. Platform owners could be prosecuted under the expanded law even if they didn’t know that people were using those platforms for sex trafficking purposes.

- Open online platforms to new criminal and civil liability for sex trafficking at both the federal and state levels.

- Expand federal criminal prostitution law to cover those who use the Internet to “promote or facilitate prostitution.” Many platforms would feel pressured to become more restrictive in their treatment of sexual speech.

- Change the law retroactively: an online platform could be prosecuted under state law or held civilly liable for sex trafficking for failing to comply with the law before it passed.

Together, these measures would effectively incentivize online platforms to over-censor their users. When platforms err on the side of censorship, it’s marginalized voices that are hit hardest.

### What does this mean for organizing?

Under this law, simply running an support email list for sex workers can get you charged with promoting or facilitating prostitution. Going forward, any organization out there working to improve the lives of sex workers must now take extreme measures to protect themselves from legal liability, or else face legal consequences

This repo seeks to establish some common sense guidelines to help these organizations navigate the many potential risks with organizing in this space
